        <section aria-labelledby="what-is-join">
          <h2 id="what-is-join">What is Join?</h2>
          <p>
            Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built
            by a group of dedicated students as part of their web development
            bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective
            method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
            efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban to
            help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual
            interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational
            exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While
            we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot
            guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other
            aspects of quality regarding Join.

        <section aria-labelledby="how-to-use">
          <h2 id="how-to-use">How to use it</h2>
          <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Join:</p>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="step-1">
          <h3 id="step-1">1. Exploring the Board</h3>
          <p>
            When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. This board
            represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do",
            "In Progress", "Await feedback" and "Done".
          </p>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="step-2">
          <h3 id="step-2">2. Creating Contacts</h3>
          <p>
            In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go
            to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the
            required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned
            tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="step-3">
          <h3 id="step-3">3. Adding Cards</h3>
          <p>
            Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
            Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
            appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in
            the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="step-4">
          <h3 id="step-4">4. Moving Cards</h3>
          <p>
            As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that
            on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to
            another.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="step-5">
          <h3 id="step-5">5. Deleting Cards</h3>
          <p>
            Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done"
            list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from
            the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this
            action is irreversible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember that using Join effectively requires consistent updates
            from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the current
            state of your project.
          </p>
